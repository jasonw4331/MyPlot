## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT report vulnerabilities on the GitHub issue tracker.**
GitHub is public and anyone can see the issues you post on the issue tracker, including people who would exploit vulnerabilities for their own gain.

**WARNING: You may put live servers at risk by reporting a vulnerability on the GitHub issue tracker.**

**Contact me** by sending an email to [**jasonwynn10@me.com**](mailto:jasonwynn10@me.com?subject=Security%20Vulnerability%20in%20MyPlot). Include the following information:

- Version of MyPlot
- Detailed description of the vulnerability (e.g. how to exploit it, what the effects are)

Please note that I can't guarantee a reply to every email.

## FAQ
### Do you offer a bug bounty?
No.

### How soon can I expect a fix for a vulnerability I've reported?
This depends on the nature of the problem. I can't provide any general ETA (nor would it be wise to provide one).
In general, it depends on when I have time to look into the problem, how complex the problem is to fix, and how many users it impacts.

When a fix for a severe vulnerability is pushed, a patch release for the target version will usually be released within 24 hours so that users can update.
