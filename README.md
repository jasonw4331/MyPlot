Have you ever seen those Java servers with the PlotSquared plugin and thought "Hey, why can't I have plots on my Minecraft server?" Well, now you can with **MyPlot** for PocketMine-MP!

A list of commands and permissions can be found in the [MyPlot Wiki](https://github.com/jasonwynn10/MyPlot/wiki) along with a helpful config guide [here](https://github.com/jasonwynn10/MyPlot/wiki/Config-File-Setup).

Want to help create language packs? If you know a language that is not created yet, you can create a new language pack by opening a pull request! If the language you know is already created, you can help improve it by editing it. Many of the current resource packs are outdated anyway :P

##### *NOTE:* MyPlot is designed to only support pmmp's version of the PocketMine-MP server software and does not support third party builds. Any changes to the code in custom installations will not be supported.
